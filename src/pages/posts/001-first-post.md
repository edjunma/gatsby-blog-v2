#Why I Started To Blog

<br>

Hello everyone, if you are reading this.. you are awesome üôè! I honestly didn‚Äôt know if anyone would read this at all at the time I‚Äôm writing this. So a high-five to you and this is one of the first posts that I will be making on this blog, just me ol me typing away and being real with you all out there.

So I started this blog because honestly, I‚Äôve always wanted to start one or something similar at least. I‚Äôve never had a place where I was able to document my thought processes, life moments, the things I‚Äôve learned, seen, loved, hated, never really had a channel like that for me. Never had a diary, Tumblr or Pinterest, and the closest thing to a blog would be Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. While on my journey to becoming a web developer, a lot of resources like Dev.to, Medium, and other developers mentioned that having a blog to document your process is extremely beneficial to both yourself and to your career, so I decided to take the leap of faith and just do it.

Now, this wasn‚Äôt just a leap that was simple, starting a blog can be quite complicated and confusing if you‚Äôve just started. There will be so many resources and information online available to you and it really takes a strong effort to get going. You can easily get overwhelmed when attempting to start a blog, you have to decide on a niche/audience, choose a domain name, hosting, customizations, themes, choosing a blogging platform, writing good content, having relevant topics, images, videos, keywords, SEO, and website analytics. All this to research and learn about was quite overwhelming at first and I‚Äôll admit I was procrastinating on designing and publishing this blog because of how unmotivated I was to start.

Nonetheless, I reminded myself that this blog is the first of many steps that I will take on in this journey called life. Nothing comes from procrastinating and setting it back, so I decided to get my notepad, pen, and laptop and began brainstorming blog post ideas, blog designs, the theme, and feel of my blog, researched other blogs and blog posts for inspiration and guidance. A lot of people say you should stick with a certain niche with your blog to maintain your audience and readers but I want this blog to be about finding myself and exploring this journey together with you guys so I will honestly write what I want but not bad stuff, hopefully I can try to provide you guys with good reads and tasty treats. Some topics I‚Äôve considered are Web Development, Gaming, Building Computers, New Technology, Product Reviews, Food, Travel, Career Advice, Self-Improvement, Physical & Mental Health, Productivity, Dogs! These are just some of the categories and topics that I‚Äôve considered about when brainstorming if there are any topics/categories or specifics you would like me to blog about then please feel free to reach out to me.
